1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,460
everybody wanted the atat from the Star

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:08,280
Wars wow it's a really exciting toy

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,860
or is it yeah his legs moving that and

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,780
the 80s ones had guns that moved and lit

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,360
up but you have to put your hand in to

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,400
operate its head and yeah the legs move

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,380
if you operate them with your hands

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,199
wouldn't it be better if it walked along

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,180
now I'm aware of a walking at a tea toy

10
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,439
which was made by thinkway but this was

11
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,779
quite a bit smaller and didn't really

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,939
walk amazingly well mostly its feet are

13
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:31,439
just sliding on the ground I suspect it

14
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,820
had a similar mechanism to the 3D

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,860
printed ones that have been going around

16
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,020
and ultimately that's because licensed

17
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,640
toys cost a lot to produce so cutting

18
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,379
down on Motors and control Electronics

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,360
is generally how things go in the toy

20
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:44,820
industry otherwise the product ends up

21
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,340
costing too much I've built quite a few

22
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,260
four-legged walking robots in the past I

23
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,820
spent years through multiple versions of

24
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,100
robot dogs before I got to something

25
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,840
that could move fast and was Dynamic but

26
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,000
I actually started with bipedal robots

27
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,520
like my the Star Wars gonk droid which

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,960
walked Along on two legs at the time I

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,940
thought if I can make something not too

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,500
bad that walks on two legs and four legs

31
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,180
should be easy but what I didn't

32
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,400
consider was that the gong drop had big

33
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,439
flat feet and typically robot dogs have

34
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,479
much smaller pointy feet which is why it

35
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,400
took me so very many versions to make a

36
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,900
robot dog that walked well but I never

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,299
went back to build a four-legged walking

38
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,640
robot with big flat feet to see how easy

39
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,619
that would be and the at 80 is a great

40
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,240
robot to convert because it's got these

41
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,640
great big flat feet with these

42
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,619
stabilizing toes I'm going to use a very

43
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,240
similar parallelogram leg mechanism to

44
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:32,520
the gong Droid which had a gear

45
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,900
reduction built into the leg I worked

46
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,400
out the geometry for this in the gong

47
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,380
Droid series which you can check out in

48
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,180
my channel essentially though it's a

49
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,400
motor with a Spur Gear Running on a

50
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,500
large partial gear and as I demonstrated

51
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,299
in the previous videos the large gear

52
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,220
just needs to be the same radius as the

53
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:48,900
top part of the parallelogram and then

54
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,240
the gears track each other just fine

55
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,040
instead of a DC motor this time I'm

56
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,259
going to use some servos with a gear

57
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,299
mounted on the servo horn just a quick

58
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,159
ad for my 3D printing sponsor thanks to

59
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,200
lol's bar for supporting my Channel with

60
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,820
3D printers having lots of printers

61
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,920
really helps get the projects done in

62
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,079
time obviously we have to make four of

63
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,880
everything because it has four legs and

64
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,280
in some cases that's actually more parts

65
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:14,040
the legs themselves have four sections

66
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,680
so we have to make 16 sticks to make our

67
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,319
four parallelogram legs and here's one

68
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,760
of the gears that goes on the servo

69
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,800
right all my parts are printed so we're

70
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,480
ready to do some assembly thanks to 3D

71
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,300
fuel for the filament for this this is

72
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,520
all pro pla plus so here are my gears

73
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,020
for the servo there's a recess so that

74
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,000
that gear can get really close to the

75
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,500
servo body but obviously those little

76
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,239
things sticking up are probably going to

77
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,520
snap off it'll be okay though because

78
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,739
the bulk of the gear is just fine the

79
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,140
servo itself fits into a Servo bracket

80
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:45,000
which is 3D printed and yes I remember

81
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,280
to leave the hole for the cable to come

82
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,940
out just on the end there so we can

83
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,940
screw them in

84
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,900
that bracket fits onto one of the pieces

85
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:56,700
of the leg there and obviously there's a

86
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,599
recess so that the gear can turn without

87
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,599
binding on it

88
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,800
the other side of the leg has that

89
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:07,140
partial spur gear on and that binds

90
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,760
nicely onto the gear that we've got so

91
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,900
now we just need to install something on

92
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,640
each end so that we've got our

93
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,560
parallelogram I've got some three

94
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,360
millimeter steel axles so now we can put

95
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,400
together the parallelogram and now we've

96
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,159
got a working mechanism with a motor in

97
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,379
it so giving that Servo a signal on some

98
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,599
power we can see that moves quite nicely

99
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:26,819
and that Servo tracks the big gear

100
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,680
perfectly just because the big gear is

101
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:30,840
the same radius as the top part of the

102
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,879
parallelogram so that's worked out well

103
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,260
again really happy if how that's turned

104
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,700
out there's hardly any slop in this as

105
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,680
well so it's actually quite a rigid

106
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,879
mechanism so with these stages stacked

107
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,099
together there's going to be hardly any

108
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,440
wobble in the legs so all we need to do

109
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:44,819
now is build the top of the leg and then

110
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,739
build four more of them and put it all

111
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:49,019
together so here's one whole leg with

112
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:50,879
its two stages so it can bend in the

113
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:52,379
middle so that gives us quite a wide

114
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,840
range of motion we've got a big enough

115
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:56,400
stripe there to walk like an AT-AT and

116
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,799
of course we can bend the leg as well to

117
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,480
pick it up so if we Bend both Motors in

118
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,099
the same direction then we can pick the

119
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,560
leg up and that gives us enough ground

120
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:06,180
clearance to take steps

121
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,920
but before we put the rest of the parts

122
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,280
for that together it's time for a quick

158
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:26,280
right time to get back to the attacks

159
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,320
so I made the whole thing four times so

160
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,539
we've got four legs each one has two

161
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,340
servos so that's eight servos but then

162
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:34,500
there's another four servos at the top

163
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,660
and that's going to enable the robot to

164
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,340
turn so we've got a plate that goes on

165
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,900
the bottom and the top and I've just got

166
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,820
some bolts which are put through there

167
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,860
so we've got pivot Points and then we've

168
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,600
got a Servo for each leg that runs on a

169
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,940
larger gear on the top plate so that we

170
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,199
can swing the legs outwards I thought it

171
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,479
was a shame to tear the head and body

172
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,400
off the original at A T so I'm printing

173
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:55,500
a new one and this is printed on the

174
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,300
lolsbot Tas long bed which has a really

175
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,639
long bed for big parts

176
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,440
so my proportions aren't quite the same

177
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,060
as the original toy but I'm pretty happy

178
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,560
with the way it's turned out and I think

179
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,660
mechanically it's going to be pretty

180
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,860
solid the headphones printing right now

181
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,020
but we're going to put some Electronics

182
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,400
in so as usual I've got an Arduino Mega

183
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,320
that's more than enough to control those

184
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,060
servos and it's got this piece of strip

185
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,380
board with all these wires broken out of

186
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,539
it with power and the signal

187
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,639
distribution for the 12 servos it's got

188
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:22,020
an RC receiver on it the orange thing on

189
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,940
there that's because we're going to be

190
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,100
using my universal remote I made which

191
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,080
is a DSM remote so check that out and my

192
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,120
channel right let's uh try and get all

193
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,919
this wired up so we've got all those

194
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,139
Electronics installed and the cables

195
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,639
rooted as best possible and zip tied on

196
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:37,560
and we've also got the head installed

197
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:40,080
the Arduino lives in there and the main

198
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,180
battery lives right at the back so I've

199
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,680
just tied the controller to the servos

200
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,479
for now so they all Bend in the same

201
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,280
direction and you can see the whole

202
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:49,620
thing goes up and down as it bends its

203
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,020
legs as you'd expect and also quite

204
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,000
helpfully it can stand on one leg so

205
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,560
those stabilizing feet really help to

206
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,120
keep it upright you wouldn't be able to

207
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,800
do that with one of my open dog projects

208
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,819
but it would just fall over in that

209
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,160
direction

210
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:03,840
but in order to take steps with one foot

211
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,180
at a time what we actually need is it

212
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,460
goes forwards is all of the other feet

213
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,380
to slide back in a perfectly straight

214
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,180
line now this is actually quite a

215
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,620
complicated mechanism here to do that

216
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,060
and we're going to do it properly so

217
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,220
we're going to calculate some inverse

218
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,780
kinematics I did a more in-depth video

219
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,060
about this before where I builds a

220
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,620
simple robot arm the calculations I did

221
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,139
for this allow me to position the end of

222
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,180
the arm into Cartesian coordinates that

223
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:29,039
means up and down and left and right in

224
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,960
straight lines the code running

225
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,300
calculates the required joint angles for

226
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,160
the two joints I use Pythagoras Theorem

227
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,800
and trigonometry to work out the angles

228
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,900
the at 80 is very similar if we consider

229
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,400
the leg to be a triangle so first I

230
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,840
worked out the angles from the required

231
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,300
length of the leg which is easy because

232
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,860
we know all three sides once this is

233
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,199
done we can set the leg length and the

234
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,240
code will work out the angles next we

235
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,620
need to move the foot back and forth we

236
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,180
can just imagine that the leg is a

237
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,340
straight line since we can set its

238
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,080
length already so we can imagine another

239
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,520
right angle triangle where we give it

240
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,680
the distance we want to move back and

241
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,240
forth the height of the body and then

242
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,460
use trigonometry to work out the

243
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,840
shoulder angle and the new leg length we

244
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,639
pass the new leg length onto the

245
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,380
previous calculation and then the body

246
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,360
will stay at the same height as the foot

247
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,800
moves back and forth the only thing I

248
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,840
didn't take into account properly was

249
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,400
this piece of the leg here because these

250
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,319
two joints don't meet so it's not a

251
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,599
perfect triangle but I just ignored that

252
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,979
and it works perfectly well so now we

253
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,720
can actually move that body up and down

254
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:26,819
as we did before but instead of just

255
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,379
moving those servos directly coupled to

256
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:30,539
the stick we're actually calculating

257
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:32,760
trigonometry and working out the leg

258
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:34,380
length and now I can pretty much slide

259
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,580
backwards and forwards as well in a

260
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,560
straight line so if you look at the

261
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,599
cabinet behind me you'll find that body

262
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,279
is tracking it at some point those

263
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,440
servos do reach their end stops though

264
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,480
and also the cheap hobby servos have

265
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,700
quite low tolerance feedback pots in

266
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,080
probably about 10 tolerance so that

267
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,240
means you probably don't get a linear

268
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,160
response out of them that along with the

269
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,839
broken triangle at the knee means that

270
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,820
we don't get a perfectly straight line

271
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,740
in any direction but we've got enough

272
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,300
that we can make it walk and the legs

273
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,920
move backwards and forwards in pretty

274
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,120
much a straight line so we can take

275
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,920
steps

276
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,540
so obviously I can move the feet

277
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,820
independently and we can put a step

278
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,440
sequencer together to make it take steps

279
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,180
you can see the foot doesn't track the

280
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,279
ground perfectly but it's good enough

281
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:16,019
for our purposes

282
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:17,880
there's one other issue we need to solve

283
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:19,260
though if I move my hand along the table

284
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,000
here so it tracks in a perfectly

285
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,740
straight line You'll see that my arm

286
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,480
gets longer in this position and it gets

287
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,399
longer in this position as we move

288
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,560
further away from the center but you'll

289
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,839
also notice that my shoulder is moving a

290
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,519
lot more than my elbow the elbow joint

291
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:34,800
hardly ever moves and my shoulder makes

292
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:37,019
most of the motion so if we were just to

293
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,880
send the two servos of the leg to

294
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:40,920
another position in a straight line like

295
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,720
this then one has to move further than

296
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,220
the other and if we just send them at

297
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,959
the speed that the servos will go at

298
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,160
which is their maximum speed then

299
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:49,320
basically one is going to get there

300
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,060
first the other one will catch up later

301
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,860
and that means we won't be moving in a

302
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,660
perfectly straight line anymore when I'm

303
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,580
driving the joints manually effectively

304
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,440
I'm scrolling through all the positions

305
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,300
from A to B because I'm moving this

306
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,279
thick quite slowly through all the

307
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,140
positions over time and the math is

308
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:05,940
being calculated 100 times a second to

309
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,740
work out the joint angles and therefore

310
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,080
the leg tracks in a straight line from

311
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,640
point A to point B but if I was just to

312
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,860
suddenly send a step from one position

313
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,200
to the next then those two joints will

314
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,940
move them maximum speed and one will get

315
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,200
there faster than the other so what we

316
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,000
need is something that will manually

317
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,920
scroll through all the positions but do

318
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,899
it automatically when we specify two

319
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,420
points and to do that we can use the

320
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:29,700
Arduino ramp Library the simplest demo

321
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,620
for that is specifying two points and

322
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,540
then opening a Serial plotter and seeing

323
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,459
the interpolation between them which is

324
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,920
a nice straight line instead of a square

325
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:40,260
wave or a step that new interpolated

326
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,300
value is fed into the inverse kinematics

327
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:44,940
so all the way through that value

328
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,980
changing over time recalculates the

329
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,360
joint angles and our feet move in a

330
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,940
straight line from position to position

331
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,800
I'm also using motion filtering on my

332
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,959
control sticks and on the servos

333
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,459
themselves on the output so I made a

334
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,380
video specifically about this you should

335
00:10:56,459 --> 00:11:00,420
check out where I made a robot head with

336
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,399
really cheap servos and controlled it

337
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,079
with an 8-bit Arduino and you can see

338
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,120
the Motions are really smooth there as I

339
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,740
move around and basically all I'm doing

340
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,660
is taking a large percentage of the

341
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,220
previous value in the loop and only a

342
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,899
small percentage of the new ones so the

343
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:16,079
values can't change too quick and we get

344
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:17,700
this lovely deceleration on the moves

345
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,560
so now if I switch a switch on the

346
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,420
controller we've got a timed sequence

347
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,060
running that lifts each foot in turn

348
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,920
pretty much the way a dog walks if I

349
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,480
push forward on one of my control sticks

350
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,579
then it takes the multiple of that

351
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,320
control stick and moves all of the feet

352
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:32,940
backwards which are on the ground and

353
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,860
the one forward which is off the ground

354
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,720
and so it walks along pretty

355
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,060
convincingly and pretty much how an

356
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,300
AT-AT walks flicking another switch

357
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:44,100
causes it to lift diagonal legs and if I

358
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,839
turn one of the controllers that causes

359
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,060
the legs to swing out at the appropriate

360
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,560
time to make it turn the legs don't

361
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,000
share a common pivot point and that

362
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,260
pivot point isn't in the middle of the

363
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,720
robot which means the feet should

364
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,519
actually move position in and out as it

365
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,959
rotates round but I didn't care about

366
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,959
that and it's light enough it doesn't

367
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:02,579
matter so it walks okay it's very wobbly

368
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,860
side to side you'll notice though

369
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:07,200
although that only happens when it walks

370
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,880
forwards if I reverse things and walk

371
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,200
backwards which I can do just by pulling

372
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,180
the stick in the other direction then

373
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,800
it's actually much more stable you'll

374
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,120
notice his bottom is much more stable

375
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,279
than the head was when it was walking

376
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,720
the other way and that is because the

377
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,459
head is making it front heavy already

378
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,959
but when it pushes all its legs back

379
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:24,839
apart from the one that's in the air

380
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:26,519
that makes it even more front heavy I

381
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,620
tried to add Mass to the back by putting

382
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:30,899
a battery on the back outside the back

383
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,579
and also having some nuts there to add

384
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:34,740
some extra mass it's pretty hard to

385
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:37,760
compensate for the 300 grams hanging so

386
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,760
far out the front though

387
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:52,860
[Music]

388
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,860
foreign

389
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:45,760
foreign

390
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:45,760
[Music]

391
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,180
that means at iet's will work if the

392
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,560
Star Wars was real life you'd actually

393
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,120
be able to send one into battle and it

394
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,740
will walk along it's quite good to know

395
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,300
that they're statically stable so it can

396
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,680
take one leg off the ground and still

397
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,940
stand there with it off the ground it

398
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,440
doesn't need to put it down again to

399
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,019
catch itself because we all know what

400
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,279
happens when at 18s fall over I'm going

401
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:06,360
to publish all the cannon go for this

402
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,680
project so if you want to have a look at

403
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,839

404
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,040
on GitHub it's totally open source so if

405
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,480
